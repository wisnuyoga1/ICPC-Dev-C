# ICPC-Dev-C ++

This repository contains my analysis and solutions for several 
**ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest)** problems.

The project focuses on **algorithm analysis**, including:
- **String manipulation algorithm** — complexity: `O(N × L²)`
- **Team strength optimization** using sorting — complexity: `O(N log N)`
- **Two-player numerical logic game simulation**

Each solution includes a **time complexity analysis**, **proof of correctness**, and **code explanation** to ensure optimal and accurate results.

This project enhanced my skills in **problem solving**, **algorithm design**, and **efficient implementation** using **C/C++**.
